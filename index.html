            <h2>Our Story</h2>
            <div class="story-content">
                <p>We're Ibrahim, Marco, and Kevin—three friends who met in 8th grade back in 2015. We grew up together, bonding over robotics in middle school and high school, and eventually all pursuing electrical and computer engineering in university.</p>
                <p>Our book club was born from our shared love of books and community. We'd often find ourselves at Barnes & Noble, browsing the shelves, picking out our next reads, and then heading to a local tea shop to enjoy tea and play chess together. It was during these moments that the idea of starting a book club naturally emerged.</p>
                <p>We meet every other Sunday to discuss the book we're reading, sharing thoughts, insights, and the joy of discovery. Our first meeting was the first Sunday of November 2025, where we decided on our inaugural book: <em>"The Secret History"</em> by Donna Tartt.</p>

                            <p class="book-comment">We found that <em>The Secret History</em> showed considerable promise in its opening chapters, with an intriguing premise and atmospheric setting that drew us in. However, as the narrative progressed, particularly in the latter half, the story lost much of its initial momentum. The pacing became increasingly sluggish, and what began as an engaging psychological thriller evolved into a laborious read. Despite our initial enthusiasm, we found ourselves struggling to maintain interest and ultimately had to push through to reach the conclusion. While the novel had the foundation for something compelling, it ultimately failed to deliver on its early potential.</p>
