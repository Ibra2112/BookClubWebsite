            <h2>Our Story</h2>
            <div class="story-content">
                <p>We're Ibrahim, Marco, and Kevin—three friends who met in 8th grade back in 2015. We grew up together, bonding over robotics in middle school and high school, and eventually all pursuing electrical and computer engineering in university.</p>
                <p>Our book club was born from our shared love of books and community. We'd often find ourselves at Barnes & Noble, browsing the shelves, picking out our next reads, and then heading to a local tea shop to enjoy tea and play chess together. It was during these moments that the idea of starting a book club naturally emerged.</p>
                <p>We meet every other Sunday to discuss the book we're reading, sharing thoughts, insights, and the joy of discovery. Our first meeting was the first Sunday of November 2025, where we decided on our inaugural book: <em>"The Secret History"</em> by Donna Tartt.</p>
